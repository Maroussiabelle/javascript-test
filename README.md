# Hello!
I will be publishing my solutions to exercises from the "JavaScript from scratch" course on stepik.org here.

"In all tasks of this course, input from the user is required. To run and test my code in IntelliJ IDEA, 
I comment out the lines containing the prompt() method with /* */ and manually assign values instead."
