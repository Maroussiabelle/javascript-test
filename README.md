# JavaScript from Scratch - Stepik Course Solutions

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my solutions to exercises from the ["JavaScript from scratch"](https://stepik.org/course/180784/syllabus) course. 

Each module's exercises are organized by filenames containing the corresponding module numbers.

## Modules Overview
Module 4: Loops

    4.1 While Loop
    4.2 For Loop

Module 5: Functions

    5.1 Introduction to Functions
    5.2 Parameters
    5.3 Return of a Value
    5.4 Arrow Functions

 Module 6: Objects

    6.1 Introduction to Objects
    6.2 Object Properties
    6.3 Object Methods

Module 7: Primitives

    7.1 Interpolation and Special Characters 
    7.2 String Properties and Methods 
    7.3 String Indexing 
    7.4 Working with Numbers, Math 

In all tasks of this course, input from the user is required. To run and test my code in IntelliJ IDEA, 
I comment out the lines containing the prompt() method with /* */ and manually assign values instead.
