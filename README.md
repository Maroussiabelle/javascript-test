# JavaScript from Scratch - Stepik Course Solutions

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my solutions to exercises from the ["JavaScript from scratch"](https://stepik.org/course/180784/syllabus) course. 

Each module's exercises are organized in directories by filenames containing the corresponding module numbers and names.



In all tasks of this course, input from the user is required. To run and test my code in IntelliJ IDEA, 
I comment out the lines containing the prompt() method with /* */ and manually assign values instead.
